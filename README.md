# Stand Up Comedy NYC

A curated, dated shortlist of NYC stand-up shows worth going out for, plus recurring bar rooms, open mics and the Manhattan clubs. Published at [standupcomedynyc.com](https://standupcomedynyc.com).

The site is static HTML, CSS and browser JavaScript. There is no database, no scraper and no server. Editors change JSON files, checks run, and a push to `main` publishes.

## Layout

```
web/                 the site as served (pages, editorial.css, scripts, assets)
web/data/            editorial data: picks, recurring, open-mics, clubs
web/data/archive/    past picks, one file per month, written by `npm run rotate`
scripts/rotate.js    moves expired picks (and their artwork) into the archive
scripts/ig-card.js   renders Instagram cards (1080x1350 JPEG) into web/assets/ig/
scripts/ig-post.js   publishes cards to Instagram; POSTED-IG.json is its log
scripts/badslava.js  pulls Badslava's New York open-mic table into candidates/ for review
scripts/heat.js      demand signals per pick (ticket availability, second shows, Wikipedia pageviews, Reddit buzz); sets the Sold out / Going fast tags
scripts/reddit.js    read-only Reddit search via a script app (REDDIT_CLIENT_ID, REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET in the environment); feeds heat.js
scripts/calendar.js  six-week content calendar from the data (Markdown for the editor, unlinked HTML page for Nick)
scripts/research-plan.js  ranks performers cheaply and schedules last30days runs only where they can change a decision; caches results 7 days; reports token savings
scripts/reddit-leads.js  promoter posts from NYC neighborhood subreddits (last 14 days) into candidates/reddit-leads.json, matched to the venue registry
scripts/perplexity-leads.js  round-up leads from Perplexity Sonar (PERPLEXITY_API_KEY): who to follow, independent shows, new rooms, announced dates, matched against the board into candidates/perplexity-leads.json; about 25 cents a run; refuses to rerun inside six days without --force; working rules in RECURRING-INTAKE.md
scripts/eventbrite.js pulls upcoming events from the Eventbrite organizer pages of registered rooms into candidates/
web/areas.js         the Neighborhoods directory: every room by borough and neighborhood
candidates/          discovery output (crowd-sourced, unverified); never served, never copied into web/data without a venue check
web/assets/fonts/    Oswald and Permanent Marker (OFL/Apache) for offline card rendering
functions/api/       Cloudflare Pages Function for POST /api/subscribe (Listmonk)
functions/_middleware.js  serves the Markdown edition when a client asks for text/markdown
scripts/markdown.js  builds the Markdown edition and llms.txt into dist/ (run by npm run build)
scripts/stamp.js     versions CSS and JS references in the built HTML (?v=hash) so browsers never serve a stale stylesheet
web/404.html, web/_headers, web/.well-known/api-catalog
editorial/            editorial policy and the hold-out list (checked by npm test, never published)
scripts/check.js     data and source checks run by `npm test` and CI
robots.txt, sitemap.xml
POSTER-SOURCES.json  provenance for every piece of artwork in web/assets/posters
DRAFT-NOTES.md, QA-NOTES.md, RECURRING-INTAKE.md, POSTER-INTAKE.md
                     editorial working notes, newest entries at the bottom
```

## Data files

| File | What it holds | Tier value |
|---|---|---|
| `web/data/picks.json` | Dated one-off shows on the home board. The flyer shelf shows every upcoming pick that has artwork, `featured` ones first, three at a time, cycling through the rest every few seconds with a slow drift on each flyer. | `featured`, `special` |
| `web/data/recurring.json` | Weekly and monthly bar shows in the home sidebar. | `recurring` |
| `web/data/open-mics.json` | Open mics grouped by night on /open-mics.html. | `open-mic` |
| `web/data/clubs.json` | Manhattan clubs with policies on /clubs.html. | `club` |
| `web/data/venues.json` | The venue registry: every room's address, neighborhood and borough. The site resolves a show's neighborhood from this file by venue name, and the check fails on any venue that isn't registered or any record whose neighborhood disagrees. Add the venue here first, then the show. Optional `calendar_url` points at the page that lists upcoming shows; optional `eventbrite_organizer` (an eventbrite.com/o/ URL) lets `npm run eventbrite` pull that room's listings as leads. Optional `photo` (`{src, credit, alt, source_url}`, file under `web/assets/venues/`) is a credited photo of the room used as Instagram card art when a pick has no poster. Optional `group` names a set of sister venues (e.g. shared owners) as one house for the Instagram carousel's per-venue mix cap. | |

Every record carries a `source_url` that was actually opened and a `verified_at` date. Unknown prices stay unknown; never guess. Artwork must be official promotional material with a credit and a record in POSTER-SOURCES.json; a show with no promotional art may instead use a credited photo of the venue (the room, its exterior or stage) from the venue's own site/press kit or a freely licensed source, recorded as `photo` on the venue's own record with credit and source_url — see `web/data/venues.json` above.

## Neighborhoods

Neighborhoods are a layer, not a label. Every room in venues.json carries one, the home filter lists every neighborhood in the registry grouped by borough (with "rooms only" on those without a dated pick this week), and /neighborhoods.html is a directory of all of them: this week's picks, the weekly rooms, the open mics and every room in each. A neighborhood with no picks still shows its rooms and mics.

## Heat and demand tags

`npm run heat` scores every upcoming pick from signals we can actually read: ticket availability in the Eventbrite page's structured data, a second show of the same title at the same room the same night, Wikipedia pageviews for touring names, and how many rooms list a performer this month. The score and its reasons go to candidates/heat.json for the editor. Only two signals reach readers: `demand: "sold_out"` when the ticket page says so and `demand: "going_fast"` for limited availability or a second show, shown as a tag on the listing and in the Markdown edition. The nightly workflow refreshes it; Mazzie's edition runs it too.

## Research skill

Mazzie has the last30days skill installed in her profile (skills/research/last30days, from mvanhorn/last30days-skill, installed by clone since Hermes's scanner flags its environment reads). It reads Reddit, Hacker News, Polymarket and GitHub for the last 30 days with no keys; reports save to her workspace/research. Her edition never runs it across the roster: `npm run research-plan` ranks every performer from static data and cheap signals, shortlists up to ten, and schedules runs only for shows within ten days that are not already decided and have no cached result under seven days old. Each run is recorded with `--record` and reused; her summary reports runs made, reused and skipped, estimated tokens saved, and candidates ranked on schedule alone for lack of recent data. The same skill is installed for Claude Code on the host.

## Leads

Three candidate feeds live in candidates/ and never reach the site directly: Badslava's open-mic table, the Eventbrite organizer pages of registered rooms (matched to the venue by the organizer link on venues.json), and promoter posts from NYC neighborhood subreddits (bar shows that never reach Eventbrite). The editor opens the page, registers the venue if needed, and only then adds a pick, room or mic.

## Venue mix

We cover everything that is happening: bar shows, back rooms, small clubs and theaters, in every borough. The board and the Instagram posts drifted toward The Bell House and Union Hall because their Eventbrite pages hand us finished posters; a poster is not a reason to pick a show and a missing one is not a reason to skip it (Nick, September 18, 2026).

- Each night of the next seven days shows at least two different rooms when two verified shows exist, and at least one bar or small-room show. No room or house (venues sharing a `group`) holds more than about a third of the coming week. `npm test` warns when the mix slips; the editor acts on it before adding more from the crowded room.
- Work the Reddit leads before the Eventbrite leads, and keep Bell House and Union Hall together to one new pick a day while they hold more than a quarter of the week. The weekly rooms in recurring.json are a source too: when a recurring bar show has a confirmed date and lineup this week on the venue's or producer's page, that night goes on the board as a dated pick. Venue `calendar_url` pages and read-only Instagram browsing of producers and small rooms (leads only, confirmed on a ticket or venue page) fill the rest.
- A show without promotional art gets the room's photo: the bar, its front or its stage, from the venue's own site or press kit or a freely licensed source, saved under `web/assets/venues/` and recorded on the venue as `photo` with credit and `source_url`. One photo serves every show in that room.

## Horizon and content calendar

The board looks six weeks ahead. The check warns for any of the next six weeks with fewer than eight picks. `npm run calendar` (also run by the build) writes candidates/content-calendar.md, a week-by-week plan from the data: picks, artwork gaps, demand tags, heat, unreviewed Eventbrite leads, the standing Instagram and Heard around town slots, and the day's research plan. The build also writes dist/calendar.html, an unlinked, noindex page in the site's style for the same view. On the site, picks more than two weeks out sit under **Save the date** below the board, with their own Markdown edition (save-the-date.md). Venues with `kind: "theater"` make a pick a **Big stage**: tagged on the board and the shelf, grouped first under Save the date, and capped to one of the shelf's three slots so touring artwork never crowds out the rooms.

## Revolving board

The board is always current and never runs dry:

- The page only renders picks whose `ends_at` is in the future, so a show leaves the board the moment it ends.
- `npm run rotate` moves expired picks into `web/data/archive/YYYY-MM.json`, moves their posters to `web/assets/posters/archive/`, and marks the provenance records archived. Nothing is deleted. A GitHub Actions job runs it every morning at 09:15 UTC and commits the result, which deploys.
- `npm run check` warns when fewer than eight picks are upcoming, when nothing is listed a week out, when an upcoming pick was last verified more than 14 days ago, or when expired picks are still in picks.json.
- Mazzie's daily edition at 11:00 UTC adds verified picks for the coming week and pushes.

## Workflow

```bash
npm test          # data checks, syntax checks, then a build into dist/
npm run rotate    # archive expired picks (--dry-run to preview, --now=ISO to test)
npm run preview   # serve dist/ on http://127.0.0.1:8080
npm run ig-card -- --tonight     # cover + one card per pick tonight (also --weekend, --pick <id>)
npm run badslava                 # refresh candidates/badslava-ny.json and print what's new
npm run heat                     # score demand per pick; sets demand (sold_out / going_fast) on picks.json
npm run eventbrite               # refresh candidates/eventbrite.json from registered rooms' organizer pages
```

1. Edit the JSON under `web/data/` or the pages under `web/`. Never edit `dist/`.
2. Run `npm test`. It fails on missing fields, duplicate IDs, non-https sources, bad dates, missing poster files, sitemap drift and syntax errors.
3. Commit with a message that says what changed editorially, and push to `main`.

GitHub Actions runs the same `npm test` on every push and pull request.

## Publishing

Cloudflare Pages (project `standupcomedynyc`) is connected to this repository's `main` branch. Each push builds with `npm run build` and deploys `dist/` to standupcomedynyc.com and www.standupcomedynyc.com, with the Pages Function providing `/api/subscribe`. A push to `main` is a public deployment.

To confirm what is live, compare a file hash rather than trusting labels:

```bash
curl -s https://standupcomedynyc.com/editorial.css | md5sum; md5sum web/editorial.css
```

## Instagram cards

`npm run ig-card -- --tonight` renders a Tonight cover and one card per pick into `web/assets/ig/`, so a push makes them public at standupcomedynyc.com/assets/ig/<id>.jpg, which the Instagram API needs. The design is photo-first: the show's artwork full-bleed with the headline in red blocks and the credit on the card; a pick without artwork falls back to the venue's `photo` (see Data files) and only then to the text-only paper card (`--paper` forces it). A real poster always outranks a venue photo when choosing the cover hero. Card URLs sent to the API carry a content hash (`?v=`) so Instagram never reuses a cached older render of the same filename. Paid listings are labeled on the card. Sold-out picks are left out of the Tonight set (they stay on the site with the tag) unless the pick carries a `walkup_note`. The Tonight set caps at 2 cards per venue (venues sharing a `group` count together, e.g. sister rooms) and interleaves houses round-robin so the carousel doesn't run all one room; over the cap the highest-ranked picks stay. `--no-mix` disables both and restores plain start-time order. `scripts/ig-post.js` selects the same set (`scripts/tonight-set.js`) so the posted carousel always matches the rendered cards. Rendering needs a Chromium headless shell: set `IG_BROWSER` or let the script find one under `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` or `~/.cache/ms-playwright`. Rotation deletes cards for expired picks and past covers.

Stories: `npm run ig-card -- --story` renders one 1080x1920 frame, `web/assets/ig/story-<date>.jpg`, with tonight's itinerary over the night's cover art, and `npm run ig-post -- --tonight --story` posts it (the API cannot attach a link sticker, so the frame prints standupcomedynyc.com/links). Mazzie's story job runs at 20:30 UTC, after the 19:00 UTC carousel. Sold-out picks are left out of both.

Posting: `npm run ig-post -- --tonight` publishes the cover plus tonight's cards as one carousel (`--story` for a story, `--pick <id>` for a single show, `--dry-run` to preview). It needs `IG_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `IG_USER_ID` in the environment, from a Meta app using the Instagram API with Instagram Login, and the cards must already be pushed so their URLs are public. Every post is appended to POSTED-IG.json and the same pick is refused twice in a day. `--refresh-token` extends the 60-day token; set `IG_TOKEN_FILE` to save it.

## Link in bio

`/links` (web/links.html) is the self-hosted link-in-bio page for Instagram; the bio URL is standupcomedynyc.com/links. Tonight's picks (or tomorrow's when tonight is empty) load from picks.json automatically, so the top of the page is always current without editing. Everything under that comes from `web/data/links.json`: ordered entries with `id`, `label`, `note`, `url`, `kind` (`site` for a page in web/, `external` for https links), optional `pinned` (gold, sorted first) and optional `starts`/`ends` dates for temporary links (a festival, a feature, a special). Outbound links get UTM tags (source instagram, medium bio) so ticket partners and analytics can see the page working. `npm run rotate` drops entries whose `ends` date has passed; `npm test` validates the file, requires the mailing-list link, and warns when `updated` is more than 14 days old. Whoever changes the file sets `updated` to that day. Keep it short: six to eight links, no listing copy.

## Instagram comments

Inbound only. `npm run ig-comments -- --list` shows unanswered comments on our posts from the last seven days; `npm run ig-comments -- --reply <comment_id> --text "..."` posts one reply under our own media and logs it to IG-REPLIES.json (never the same comment twice, at most 20 replies a day, no outside links). Mazzie's comment job runs at 14:00 and 23:00 UTC and follows the reply policy in her persona: answer real questions from the data, thank reshares, acknowledge corrections, ignore spam and arguments, send Nick anything uncertain. Direct messages: `npm run ig-messages -- --list` shows conversations waiting on us and `npm run ig-messages -- --send <user_id> --text "..."` answers one, only inside Instagram's 24-hour reply window and only to someone who wrote first (message requests from strangers may need accepting in the app before the API sees them). Same log, same daily cap. The account never likes, follows, cold-DMs or comments elsewhere.

## Agents and crawlers

The build writes a Markdown edition of every section (index.md, this-week.md, rooms.md, open-mics.md, clubs.md, neighborhoods.md) plus llms.txt into dist/ from the same JSON. A Pages middleware returns the Markdown version of a page when the request prefers `text/markdown`, with a Link header pointing at it either way. `/.well-known/api-catalog` (RFC 9727 linkset) lists the JSON data files, and `web/_headers` sets their content types and open CORS on /data/. A real 404 page means unknown paths no longer return the home page with a 200.

## Blurbs: why this one

Every pick's `description` is one sentence that answers "why this one tonight?", the judgment a friend would make, not a restatement of the listing. `npm test` warns on describe-only patterns (host-and-lineup lists, "a ... show at the venue") so they get rewritten before they ship on the site, the Instagram cards and the caption. The judgment must come from the lineup, room, format or research, never invented. Sell the show on its own facts: no put-downs of other shows, other venues or the room's own usual bill ("instead of the club's generic lineup"), and no scarcity or exclusivity claims nobody sourced ("rare", "you won't see this anywhere else", "flies in"). A comparison is fine only when the page states both sides, such as a price or a seat count. `npm test` warns on these too.

## Editorial policy and hold-outs

`editorial/EDITORIAL-POLICY.md` states what we promote and what we don't. `editorial/holdouts.json` is Nick's case-by-case list of names we do not list; `npm test` fails if a held-out name appears in any data file. Borderline cases go to Nick with a link and a sentence, unpublished. The list is never published.

## Newsletter

`web/subscribe.html` and `web/signup.js` post to `/api/subscribe`, which forwards to the public Listmonk subscription endpoint for the Stand Up Comedy NYC list. No secrets are involved; keep it that way.
